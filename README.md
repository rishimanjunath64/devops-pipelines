Testing the CI pipeline


just push your code to github
1.git add .
2.git commit -m "your_message"
3.git push

Once you push, your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) detects the change â€” usually via a .yml configuration file â€” and automatically starts running.


ðŸ§  Example: GitHub Actions

If you have a file like this:

.github/workflows/ci.yml

GitHub will automatically trigger the pipeline when you push, if the file starts with:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev


ðŸ§¾ To verify your CI is running

Go to your GitHub repo â†’ Actions tab

Youâ€™ll see a new workflow run with the status: ðŸŸ¡ running â†’ ðŸŸ¢ success â†’ ðŸ”´ failed





yaml file explaination

Top-level

name: CI Pipeline â€” human-readable name for the workflow shown in GitHub Actions UI.

on: â€” event(s) that trigger the workflow.

push: branches: [ main ] â€” run this workflow when code is pushed to the main branch.

Jobs block

jobs: â€” a collection of jobs this workflow will run.

build: â€” job identifier (you can name it anything). Groups the steps that form the build pipeline.

runs-on: ubuntu-latest â€” the virtual machine image (runner) that executes the job.

Steps (inside the job)

Each steps: entry runs in order on the runner.

- name: Checkout code / uses: actions/checkout@v4
Pulls your repositoryâ€™s files into the runner so later steps can access the code.

- name: Set up Node.js / uses: actions/setup-node@v4 / with: node-version: 20
Installs the specified Node.js version on the runner so npm and node commands work predictably.

- name: Cache dependencies / uses: actions/cache@v4 â€¦
Stores and restores npm cache between runs to speed up npm install. (Optional but speeds builds.)

- name: Install dependencies / run: npm install
Installs project dependencies listed in package.json so tests and builds can run.

- name: Run tests / run: npm test
Executes your test script (whatever npm test runs) and fails the job if tests fail.
